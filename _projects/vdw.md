introduction: >
    Vancouver Design Week is a non-profit social enterprise with the mission to promote and celebrate designers of all disciplines in Vancouver. I joined the organizing team initally as a part of the web team. As we neared towards launching our 2017 event, I jumped around branding, print design, social media and coordination, where needed.<br/><br/>
