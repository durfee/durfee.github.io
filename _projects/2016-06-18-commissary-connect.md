Diversification, taking things in stride, asking for help, and realising the best designs are the obvious ones. I can’t really quantify how long each of these things took me to understand this term, but these are the things I attribute the completion and (by my standards) mild to moderate success of our deep dive.

As the term started out, our team’s ambition was really only matched by our naïvaite about what we were getting ourselves into. Starting out, we were lost. 100%. Either through a misguided sense of having prior experience or through an instinctual tick, I believed that for better or worse I was going to try and lead the team out of our pickle. So focused was I on this task, that talking to our client was something that I either forgot or was too afraid of damaging my pride to do. This was lesson number 1.
As soon as we came away from our design brief, we all knew something was wrong — internally and externally. We quickly settled on two key issues: communication and figuring out what “design” actually was. The communication issue was the easy part and was quickly rectified by setting up regular meetings with both our client and with each other, having rolling milestones and deadlines, and splitting up tasks internally (lesson number part 2, lesson number 2)

While “learning design” might not be the right term for it, we flipped our thinking on its head. Instead of thinking along the lines of “what can we deliver”, we switched to “What does our client need and how can we deliver the best possible solution?” (lesson number 3)

To say the least the difference was night and day.

We began focusing on thinking outside of the box, looking for inspiration, and analysing our constraints. Overused ambiguous terms like “database” and “ecosystem” were thrown out and Simon Sinek’s “Why, How, What” that become our guiding mantra through every thinking stage. We found inspiration in odd places and came up with weird ideas (see: Commissary Connect certification program, inspired by the B Corp program) that didn’t pan out, but unlike before it all felt *okay*. Instead of panicking over lost time, we just put it down as something to consider in the future. In the end, we had almost entirely lost our mentality of “what can we deliver” and were completely focused on how what we delivered would be beneficial for the client.
Ok cool story. So we did all these things. We sweat-blood-and-tears’ed together (not actually — I don’t think there was any bleeding or crying), but what am I — the greedy, self-centered person that I am — coming away with.
Diversify. One person cannot do anywhere close to everything needed to do a project like this and multiple people within the same field don’t get the best results. Keeping tasks split up, playing to people’s strengths [aside: thank goodness for Ava’s ability to project manage – I don’t think I’ll ever be able to do that half as well as she can], and always bringing in new ideas are all things I will always be integrating into all my new projects.
Take things in stride. Big problems are scary. Before the Design Brief Debacle of 2015, we were so overwhelmed by the big elephant in the room of what we were going to do, that we got little to nothing done. Break down the problem through your desired method (Business Model Canvas, Six Years Six Months Six Weeks, Why How What, etc.) and focus on one small thing at a time.
Ask for help. Swallow your pride. Understanding the problem is 99% of the problem. If something isn’t working talk to people. Working in isolation does period not period work period.

Realise the best designs are the obvious ones. Over thinking things is (apparently) my forté and something that I still need to work aggressively on. Remembering the heart of the problem or issue (by way of sticky notes or weeklies) is beyond critical to making sure the end product doesn’t suffer from feature bloat, gets off topic, or doesn’t help the client.
Pinning down exactly what it was that made this class so insightful and inspiring was hard to pin down. Sure, those things I learned were important, but beyond all that, I think it came down to how I perceived what design was. Going into the class, it was the harmonious combination between form and function, which to some degree I still believe is the case, but coming out of it has shown me it is also so, so much more.

Design isn’t just a visual thing restricted to graphic designers and the circle-jerk that is Dribbble and Behance. Design is Public, Playground Inc., Dossier, Apple, and Facebook . Design is taking the babbling, incoherent vision of a client (or your own dream, class project, manager, etc) and turning it into something so harmonious that the client says, “Oh, yeah, of course”.

That is good design.
