introduction: >
    [Quander](https://quander.io) is a hybrid event management platform and production company that helps individuals and companies connect with their customers through VR experiences. [House House](https://house-house.design) was contracted to build an custom registration flow for one of their clients.<br/><br/>
    I was the front-end developer and designer for the project. Visit the full project [here](quander.now.sh), though please be mindful of making bookings as the site is live. Unless you're in London, then go wild.<br/><br/>
