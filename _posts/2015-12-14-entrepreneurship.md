Starting a business is like starting a new relationship. The series of emotions and ideas follow identical patterns, but unlike relationships many of you are obstinately convinced that being an entrepreneur is a near impossible feat.

Perhaps it’s because I’m socially inept on a level that would make introverts feel comfortable, but I passionately believe that being an innovator requires as much care as being in a relationship. You’re probably thinking, that’s all well and good, but those two things are most certainly not the same thing. Come on, get your shit together. Bear with me.

### A relationship can be broken down into five phases

1. You connect with someone on an emotional or physical level.

2. You spend some time with that person.

3. Things start to get serious, and after a while, you commit yourself to that person.

4. Of course, something fails horribly. Your heart explodes.

5. Post ice cream, booze, and binge watching of Friends, you pick up the pieces and the whole cycle repeats itself.

We’ve all been there, right? And have come out on the other side with more experience, more stories, and—after some time, hopefully—a few lessons.

### Those phases compared to starting a business

1. You find an idea that you like so you flirt with it for a little while.

2. You gage interest, and start prototyping.

3. You spend some more time with your idea; get to know it further.

4.  If you’re lucky, things fall into place and start to get more serious. You find yourself working 80-hour weeks—but are loving it, because it leaves you feeling satisfied.

5. As most good things often do, a part of it will break. Something will fail. You walk away with your lessons, the experiences, and pride in the knowledge that you tried. The next idea will come along and you’ll try again; you’ll keep learning.

See? Not that different.

> IT SHOULD BE A LOVE AFFAIR

“Innovator” or “entrepreneur” are loaded titles that come with a whole slew of preconceptions and judgements. Let’s put those aside for a moment. People in committed and healthy relationships don’t receive titles or prestige, but they still care enough to make sure the relationship worked and lasted. Innovators and entrepreneurs are just people who cared enough about an idea to see it come into reality. They knew that failure was a possibility, but put themselves out there for the world to see anyways.

Treat your ideas with the same respect you give your partner. Know that everything will not always work out and you cannot possibly please everyone, but having the courage, strength, devotion, and confidence to try? That’s innovation. Being an entrepreneur is just putting the idea out into the world and that is something that everyone can do.

So, take a chance on that idea you were flirting with. Be courageous and embrace failure. Be daring and do your best work.
