# ∆ Thinking

Design thinking is not something that easily comes to people, myself included. My own little adventure in design has by no means been extensive or trying. In fact, I have absolutely no basis for being able to talk about this, but hey it’s a learning process. So maybe by writing about how my process has come together and how I can further critique it means that maybe I can help others get on their own track faster? We’ll see.

### Step 1: Watch your approach
Some very wise sages have oft said the importance of looking to the past to understand the present and future. This means looking at how customers have been treated in the past and how you can improve that. Or maybe if you are working for a client, this might mean understanding how their business has been functioning in the past and analyzing what trends and themes brought them to where they are today. Recognizing the themes and trends across products, ideas, and styles gives you insight into the market, but more importantly how people think. Sitting down with a client and talking about their past and their vision for the future is always the first thing that I do. Don’t even try to start working on things until this is done. Not only does it give me context for where my work is going to go, but it is a good indicator of what I’m getting myself into. If the client can’t speak to their past and why they are looking for change, that should be a warning flag.

### Step 2: Problems are hard, don’t make them harder
Looking at a new project is terrifying. The more you think about it, the more you realize how much you have to do, how little time you have, and how many constraints you have. After a little hyperventilating, six cups of coffee, and a long swim, dive right in.
> Quantify what you have to do.
There are so many good tools out there to do this, it’s amazing. Sticky notes to mood boards; [creative briefs]() to the [Business Model Canvas](); group pow-wows to crazy ideas — really it doesn’t matter which you choose. I’ve had success with most of these and have yet to try the others, but they all do the same thing: give you a plan of attack and define the terms you’re working under. From there it’s just execution and that’s [the easy part](). I’m all for going for going on aimless bike rides, but a casual bike ride isn’t a 200 hour time investment — so have a plan.

### Step 3: Make friends
Collaborate with people that aren’t your client. Holy dear flying spaghetti monster find people to collaborate with. This took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out. Being in a setting where you can bounce ideas off of people — ideally outside of your immediate bubble — is 100% guaranteed to make your design thinking strategy better. The ideas might be [“bad” or “silly”](), but will always be able to contribute something to the process.

###Step 4: Never think you are done learning
If I had a dollar for the number of times that I’ve thought to myself, “I know how to [x]! Cool! Implementing this will be easy” I would be able to pay rent for a few months. If you think there is only one way to do something, that one idea is superior, or you’ve read enough about something you’re gonna have a bad time. [Consider your point of view temporary](). Keep reading, keep learning, keep trying, and never stop failing.

### Step 5: Don’t trust advice from people who say they changed their entire life in any number of “easy”, “secret”, or “tricky” steps.
They usually have no idea what they’re talking about.

To put this in the context of our recent class project, it’s been an interesting learning experience. In a lot of ways, the material covered in the course has been an exercise in reinforced learning and putting labels on things that I previously just did without knowing that it was a pre-established method. It has certainly been very encouraging that I haven’t been approaching things completely incorrectly. More than that though, it has shown me that I have a lot of room for improvement and expansion.

Normally my approach to a project is a somewhat hybridized method between Lockwood’s and Raney and Jaooby’s methods, but with some outside influence. This has largely consisted of breaking down the problem, getting inspired, prototyping, and constantly launching, tweaking, and relaunching. Working within the course has been a little different however. Being a freelancer, I’m largely used to working alone (hence the slow learning referenced in step 3) and working in the collaborative setting of the design studio has taught me two important things, especially with my leadership style.

1. Ideas evolve quickly, but sometimes a little too quickly.
Part of my leadership style that I pride myself on (but sometimes bemoan) is getting everyone on board with an idea before moving forward. When working with really small teams (two or four), this usually means bouncing a few ideas off of each other, coming to a decision collectively and moving forward. Yet in the instance of the class, on-boarding such a diverse group is much harder. At this point, I’m not sure how I should proceed with this knowledge, but is something that I need to keep in mind.

2. Harnessing the big picture is hard.
When reading through the [Ten Faces post](), I self-identified as a hybrid between a Cross-Pollinator and a Hurdler, but (as previously mentioned) most of my leadership experience is not in leading teams across projects, so I am interested to see how both of these play into the group dynamic as the term goes on. Or maybe they won’t and I’ve got some [seriously bad]() [cognitive bias]().
