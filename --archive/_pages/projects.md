I have been humbled to work with some pretty amazing people over the years. Below are some select visual samples from some of my recent projects. Each piece introduces the client and my position on the team, but is the final product. These do not detail any of the decision making, process, or code (where applicable) that happened along the way. 

If something catches your eye or you would like details on something specific, please do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:sean@house-house.design)! I love talking process and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
